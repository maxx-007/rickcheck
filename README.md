## Fare Calculation

Based on **Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Department** official tariff (effective 01/02/2025):

- **Minimum Fare**: ‚Çπ26.00
- **Per KM Rate**: ‚Çπ17.14
- **Night Surcharge**: 25% (12:00 AM - 5:00 AM)
- **Waiting Charges**: 10% of basic fare per minute
- **Luggage Charges**: ‚Çπ6 per package (>60√ó40 cms)

### Calculation Formula
```javascript
fare = Math.max(distance * 17.14, 26.00)
if (waitingTime > 0) fare += waitingTime * (17.14 * 0.1)
if (nightTime) fare += fare * 0.25
finalFare = Math.round(fare) // Rounded to nearest rupee
```

## Key Technologies

### **Location Tracking**
- **expo-location**: High-accuracy GPS positioning
- **Haversine Formula**: Precise distance calculation
- **Real-time Updates**: 1-second interval tracking

### **Motion Detection**
- **expo-sensors**: Accelerometer and gyroscope integration
- **Movement Classification**: Stationary, low, moderate, high movement
- **Halt Detection**: Automatic waiting time calculation

### **User Interface**
